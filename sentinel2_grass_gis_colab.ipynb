        "Jupyter Notebooks are server-client applications that allow code written in a notebook document to be edited and executed through a web browser. They can be run on a local computer that does not require Internet access, as well as used to control computations on a remote server accessed via the Internet ([documentation](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)).\n",

        "Editing a Jupyter notebook is very easy: in the web browser, you can navigate between text or code blocks (\"cells\") using the mouse or keyboard shortcuts (see Menu > Help > Keyboard Shortcuts). You can execute small code segments cell by cell, save the notebook in its current state, or modify and recalculate cells or return them to their previous state. In addition to executable code cells, you can use Markdown in documentation cells to make them presentable to others.\n",
